<h2 class="chapter"><a name="TOC1"></a>1 Overview</h2>

<p>The documented and supported method to build MP4v2 uses the GNU build system (also known as the Autotools). You must first obtain the sources by either downloading and extracting the source-distribution bundle or working directly MP4v2's Subversion repository. We have build documents for both methods, but unless you are a member of the MP4v2 project, you are <b>strongly encouraged</b> to use the source-distribution method.

<p>On other supported platforms which lack Autotools we provide an alternative method for building the software. Please see the appropriate platform section.

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="TOC2"></a>2 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the recommended process to build MP4v2 from a source-distribution bundle. This process is a <b>subset</b> of the process to build directly from the project's repository. If you are interested in building from the repository then this document is not for you.

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="TOC3"></a>3 Quickstart</h2>

<p>This chapter is for the impatient or those just looking for a quick summary of all the commands used in a typical build. You may skip this summary and jump to <a href="#Build-Process">Build Process</a>.

<pre class="example">tar xf mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.bz2
cd mp4v2-2.0-r237/
rm -fr build/
mkdir build/
cd build/
../configure
make
make install
make install-man
</pre>
<p><a name="Build-Process"></a>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="TOC4"></a>4 Build Process</h2>

<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC5"></a>4.1 Extract</h3>

<p>Extract sources from a source-distribution bundle. Releases are available from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2">http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2</a> in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2/downloads/list">downloads</a> section.

<pre class="example">tar xf mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.bz2
cd mp4v2-2.0-r237/
</pre>
<p>Older versions of <code>tar</code> may not automatically uncompress the bundle, so you might have to either enter additional flags manually, or first decompress the bundle before extracting. Some possible command variations for uncompressing a <samp><span class="file">bz2</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">tar xjf mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.bz2
bunzip2 -c mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
bzcat mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
</pre>
<p>And for a <samp><span class="file">gz</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">tar xzf mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.gz
gunzip -c mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.gz | tar xf -
gzcat mp4v2-2.0-r237.tar.gz | tar xf -
</pre>
<p><a name="Configure"></a>

<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC6"></a>4.2 Configure</h3>

<p>The following command configures the project for a build.  It is highly recommended that you invoke configure from an empty directory.

<pre class="example">rm -fr build/
mkdir build/
cd build/
../configure
</pre>
<p>Please see <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> for details on configure usage, and standard options. Additionally, the following custom options have been added to <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-debug</span></samp>'<dd>Do not generate debug information.  Do not direct compiler to generate debugging information. By default the compiler will generate debug information if the platform supports it.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-optimize</span></samp>'<dd>Do not optimize. Do not direct compiler to optimize code. By default compiler optimization is enabled if the platform supports it.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-fvisibility</span></samp>'<dd>Do not set default ELF symbol visibility. By default configure attempts to detect if the compiler supports this feature. However on some platforms detecting incompatibilty of this feature might not be accurate in which case this option should be given.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-gch</span></samp>'<dd>By default certain platforms are marked to use GCC precompiled headers. Generally this greatly decrease build times but may require more diligence for iterative development; that is to say dependencies may not properly be tracked and more frequent <samp><span class="command">make clean</span></samp> may be required when headers are changed. Use this option to disable GCC precompiled headers.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-largefile</span></samp>'<dd>On some 32-bit platforms or configurations it might be desirable to build without largefile (LFS) support. By default configure attempts to detect formal LFS support and enables it if found.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--disable-util</span></samp>'<dd>Do not build/install utilities. This is convenience option for users who desire to skip building the utilities (eg. command-line executables) which are enabled by default.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-bi=ARCH</span></samp>'<dd>On bi-arch capable platforms it is possible to generate 32 or 64 bit code. This is supported by adding arguments `<samp><span class="samp">-m32</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">-m64</span></samp>', respectively, when compiling or linking. Use this option to override the platform-specific default.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-ub[=ARCHS]</span></samp>'<dd>On OSX systems it is possible to generate universal binaries. This is supported by adding one or more argument patterns `<samp><span class="samp">-arch ARCH</span></samp>' when compiling or linking. Use this option to either target an architecture different from the platform default, or to produce universal binaries.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--enable-dependency-tracking</span></samp>'<dd>Enable automatic dependency tracking for include-files. By default this feature is disabled.

</dl>

<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC7"></a>4.3 Build</h3>

<p>The following command will build MP4v2.

<pre class="example">make
</pre>
<p>On some platforms <code>make</code> refers to a BSD-flavor of make which is not compatible with this project. Check if <code>gmake</code> is installed, and if it is, substitute <code>gmake</code> wherever you may see <code>make</code> in this document. Otherwise you will need to install GNU make package version 3.81 or higher. Lower versions might work.

<p><a name="Install"></a>

<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC8"></a>4.4 Install</h3>

<p>The following command will install MP4v2.

<pre class="example">make install
make install-man
</pre>
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="TOC9"></a>5 Platform Notes</h2>

<p>MP4v2 builds on many unix-style platforms, also commonly referred to as posix-style systems. Building on Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Cygwin, Windows are known to work.

<p>Similar platforms should also work. Please see the following platform specific notes for instructions on commonly used options for various platforms.

<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC10"></a>5.1 Mac OS X</h3>

<p>Building on Mac OS X is well supported as it is used by maintainers of this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

     <ul>
<li>Mac Intel hardware
<li>Mac OS X 10.5.5
<li>Xcode-3.1.2
<li>gcc 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5490)
<li>gcc 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5566)
</ul>

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime requirements for your users. There are of course many valid reasons to build with unbundled compilers, but be aware that is generally unsupported and left as an exercise to the reader. 
</blockquote>

<h4 class="subsection"><a name="TOC11"></a>5.1.1 Default Binaries</h4>

<p>The preferred method to produce default binaries is to run configure without any options which will compile with debug+optimize and produce static+shared libraries and dynamic executables.

<pre class="example">../configure
</pre>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="TOC12"></a>5.1.2 Release Binaries</h4>

<p>The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for releases, (ie. which does not contain debug information) is to pass the following to configure:

<pre class="example">../configure --disable-debug
</pre>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="TOC13"></a>5.1.3 Developer Binaries</h4>

<p>The preferred method to produce binaries suitable for development is to pass the following to configure.  Default Binaries will work, however for the best debugging experience we recommend no optimize and no static libraries.

<pre class="example">../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static
</pre>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="TOC14"></a>5.1.4 Universal Binaries - all architectures</h4>

<p>The preferred method to produce universal binaries for all supported architectures is to pass the following option to configure. As of this writing, architectures { i386, x86_64, ppc, ppc64 } are built.

<pre class="example">../configure --enable-ub
</pre>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="TOC15"></a>5.1.5 Universal Binaries - selected architectures</h4>

<p>The preferred method to produce universal binaries for selected architectures is to specify a comma-delimited list specifying the desired architecture identifiers. Passing the following option will produce universal binaries for architectures { i386, x86_64 }.

<pre class="example">../configure --enable-ub=i386,x86_64
</pre>
<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC16"></a>5.2 Linux</h3>

<p>Building on Linux is well supported as it is used by maintainers of this project. The following are the recommended specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

     <ul>
<li>Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
<li>Fedora 9, gcc 4.3.0
<li>gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection"><a name="TOC20"></a>5.2.4 Bi-arch compilation</h4>

<p>The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.

<pre class="example">../configure --enable-bi=32
</pre>
<blockquote>
<b>Warning:</b> Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking. 
</blockquote>

<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC21"></a>5.3 FreeBSD</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> As of this writing, Cygwin has available to it several versions of gcc; only one of which may be found and used in the path as <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code>. Configure will thus find what is probably the older more stable version of gcc in a typical Cygwin environment. If you desire to build with the newer gcc, it is found in the path as <code>gcc-4</code> and <code>g++-4</code> respectively and you must indicate to configure the desired versions. Defining the following variables beforing running configure should do the trick:

<h3 class="section"><a name="TOC35"></a>5.6 Windows</h3>

<p>Native builds on Windows is supported via Microsoft's Visual Studio package. Both the commercial version and free version (express) are known to work. The following are the recommended specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

     <ul>
<li>Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
<li>Windows 2000 or higher, Visual Studio 9.0 (aka. Visual Studio 2008)
<li>Visual Studio 9.0 Express is reported to work
</ul>

<p>Only 32-bit binaries are targeted, and win32-API is set to Windows 2000 or higher. Older versions of Windows, or win32-API are not supported.

<p>MP4v2 has directory <samp><span class="file">vstudio9.0/</span></samp> which contains the necessary solution+project files to produce a basic build of libmp4v2's DLL and several command-line executables. Enabling things such as debugging, optimization, etc, are all left as an exercise to the user.

<blockquote>
<b>Warning:</b> Project meta-data is stored in header <samp><span class="file">project.h</span></samp>. A proper source distribution is built using autotools and generates <samp><span class="file">TOP/include/mp4v2/project.h</span></samp> correctly, which is then bundled with our source distribution. This is adequate for building on the Windows platform.

     <p>However, if you are building from the repository, be warned that there is no method to automatically generate <samp><span class="file">project.h</span></samp> on Windows. Instead, we periodically checkin a copy of this file (generated using autotools) as <samp><span class="file">vstudio9.0/include/mp4v2/project.h</span></samp> which may from time to time get out of date. If it is significantly out of date, you should find the latest source distribution and copy the <samp><span class="file">project.h</span></samp> from there.
