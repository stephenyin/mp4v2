@chapter What's New?
Welcome! This is the inaugural release of @value{PROJECT.name}.

This project's goal is to continue development of a C-library named @file{libmp4v2} which was once a part of the (now defunct) MPEG4IP project. That library, and some related command-line utilities were branched from MPEG4IP version 1.6.1 to seed this project, @value{PROJECT.name}.

@chapter Breaking Changes
@section Top-level header file
This release is @b{nearly} 100% API compatible with MPEG4IP, however there are some differences. Dependents of this library @b{must} now include the top-level public header file as follows. @b{This is the only supported mechanism to include the library}. We do not support attempts to include any sub-level header files; such files are private implementation details and their naming must not be relied upon.

@example
#include <mp4v2/mp4v2.h>
@end example

@section Command-line utilities
The command-line utilities have been totally rewritten and enhanced. Help usage has been made more consistent and enhanced, please invoke the appropriate utility in this fashion for more details:

@example
@i{command} --help
@end example

@appendix SCM repository details
@example
url:  @value{PROJECT.repo.url}

@end example
